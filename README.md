# React 19 useEffect Dependency Error: Conditional Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `useEffect` hook in React 19, specifically related to conditional updates based on state values.  The issue arises from incorrectly managing the dependencies within `useEffect` and leads to unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The provided code snippet demonstrates an `useEffect` hook that attempts to update the document title based on a count state variable. However, a conditional statement (`if (count > 0)`) prevents the title update when `count` is 0. This means that the document title is never updated initially because the first render of the component will have count set to 0.  This is problematic and can lead to inconsistent UI behavior.

## Solution

The correct way to address this is to ensure that the `useEffect` hook is called every time the `count` changes. This is done by including `count` in the dependency array and removing the conditional statement. The update will then occur regardless of the value of `count`.
